1. GradientDescent.py is the baisc code.
2. A lib is on the way of coding.
3. Images are about the running result.

PNG files are the final output result of python files, mainly from 3 layers to show how gradient_descent works.
Each file have a function of real-time updating picture, which means when you're running the program, the output picture will be updated dynamically and you can see the procedure that how losses descents in the direction of gradient.
